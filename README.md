# TS mod template

A template for making mods in TS for sandboxels. It's primarily made for esbuild,
but you can manually use tsc if you want to.

Esbuild is used by the build script because it's much faster than TSC, but if you
prefer another build system, you can make a build script for it or invoke it manually.
